# Spider-Walk
Developed an algorithm to optimize spider web navigation using Python and dynamic programming. By 
minimizing the number of bridges needed for Charlotte, the spider, to reach her favorite corner, I applied graph 
theory to model the web's structure and enhance navigation efficiency. This project strengthened my skills in 
problem-solving, specifically in graph traversal and optimization techniques.
